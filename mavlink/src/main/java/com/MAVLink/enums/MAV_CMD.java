 * Commands to be executed by the MAV. They can be executed on user request, or as part of a mission script. If the action is used in a mission, the parameter mapping to the waypoint/mission message is as follows: Param 1, Param 2, Param 3, Param 4, X: Param 5, Y:Param 6, Z:Param 7.

          It is also needed to specify the target camera in missions.

          When used in a mission, an autopilot should execute the MAV_CMD for a specified local camera (param1 = 1-6), or resend it as a command if it is intended for a MAVLink camera (param1 = 7 - 255), setting the command's target_component as the param1 value (and setting param1 in the command to zero).
          If the param1 is 0 the autopilot should do both.

          When sent in a command the target MAVLink address is set using target_component.
          If addressed specifically to an autopilot: param1 should be used in the same way as it is for missions (though command should NACK with MAV_RESULT_DENIED if a specified local camera does not exist).
          If addressed to a MAVLink camera, param1 can be used to address all cameras (0), or to separately address 1 to 7 individual sensors. Other values should be NACKed with MAV_RESULT_DENIED.
          If the command is broadcast (target_component is 0) then param 1 should be set to 0 (any other value should be NACKED with MAV_RESULT_DENIED). An autopilot would trigger any local cameras and forward the command to all channels.
