/**
 * Coordinate frames used by MAVLink. Not all frames are supported by all commands, messages, or vehicles.

      Global frames use the following naming conventions:
      - "GLOBAL": Global coordinate frame with WGS84 latitude/longitude and altitude positive over mean sea level (MSL) by default.
        The following modifiers may be used with "GLOBAL":
        - "RELATIVE_ALT": Altitude is relative to the vehicle home position rather than MSL.
        - "TERRAIN_ALT": Altitude is relative to ground level rather than MSL.
        - "INT": Latitude/longitude (in degrees) are scaled by multiplying by 1E7.

      Local frames use the following naming conventions:
      - "LOCAL": Origin of local frame is fixed relative to earth. Unless otherwise specified this origin is the origin of the vehicle position-estimator ("EKF").
      - "BODY": Origin of local frame travels with the vehicle. NOTE, "BODY" does NOT indicate alignment of frame axis with vehicle attitude.
      - "OFFSET": Deprecated synonym for "BODY" (origin travels with the vehicle). Not to be used for new frames.

      Some deprecated frames do not follow these conventions (e.g. MAV_FRAME_BODY_NED and MAV_FRAME_BODY_OFFSET_NED).
