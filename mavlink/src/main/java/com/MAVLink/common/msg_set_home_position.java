/**
 * 
        Sets the home position.
	The home position is the default position that the system will return to and land on.
        The position is set automatically by the system during the takeoff (and may also be set using this message).
        The global and local positions encode the position in the respective coordinate frames, while the q parameter encodes the orientation of the surface.
        Under normal conditions it describes the heading and terrain slope, which can be used by the aircraft to adjust the approach.
        The approach 3D vector describes the point to which the system should fly in normal flight mode and then perform a landing sequence along the vector.
        Note: the current home position may be emitted in a HOME_POSITION message on request (using MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE with param1=242).
